Assignment:


Create a function that takes a filename as an argument and prints the 
number of lines in the file. Call this function from your script with 
different filenames. 



#!/bin/bash 
cnt_lines() { 
	filename="$1" 
	if [ -f "$filename" ]; then 
		lines=$(wc -l < "$filename") 
		echo "Number of lines in $filename: $lines" 
	else 
		echo "File $filename not found." 
	fi 
} 
# Call the function with different filenames 
cnt_lines "file1.txt" 
cnt_lines "file2.txt"
