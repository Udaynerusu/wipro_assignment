Assignment:


Write a script that reads numbers from the user until they enter '0'. The script 
should also print whether each number is odd or even. 


Code:


#!/bin/bash 
while true; do 
read -p "Enter a number (0 to exit): " num 
if [ "$num" -eq 0 ]; then 
	break 
elif [ "$(($num % 2))" -eq 0 ]; then 
	echo "$num is even." 
else 
	echo "$num is odd." 
fi
done
