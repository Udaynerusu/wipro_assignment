Assignment 3:


 Explain the ACID properties of a transaction in your own words. Write SQL statements to simulate a transaction that includes locking and demonstrate different isolation levels to show concurrency control.



The ACID properties are fundamental principles in database management systems that ensure the reliability and consistency of transactions:



1. Atomicity:


 This property ensures that a transaction is treated as a single unit of work. It means that either all the operations within the transaction are completed successfully and the changes are committed, or none of them are completed and the changes are rolled back. There is no partial completion.


2. Consistency:


 Consistency ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another. It means that all integrity constraints, such as foreign key constraints, unique constraints, etc., are maintained before and after the transaction.


3. Isolation:


 Isolation ensures that the concurrent execution of transactions produces a result that is the same as if transactions were executed serially (one after another). It prevents interference between transactions by providing each transaction with a view of the database that appears as if no other transactions are executing concurrently.


4.Durability:


 Durability ensures that once a transaction has been committed, the changes made by that transaction persist even in the event of system failure. These changes are permanently stored in the database and cannot be lost.
