Assignment 2: Develop a case study analyzing the implementation of SDLC phases in a real-world engineering project. Evaluate how Requirement Gathering, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance contribute to project outcomes.

example: an ecommerce website


SDLC Phases: 


1. Requirement Gathering phase:


1. The project team conducts market research, surveys, and interviews with stakeholders to gather requirements.

2. Requirements include website functionality (product catalog, shopping cart, checkout process), user experience (navigation, search functionality), security measures (payment gateway integration, data encryption), and scalability (handling high traffic volumes).

3. Collaboration with marketing, sales, and IT teams ensures that requirements are comprehensive, aligned with business goals, and meet customer needs.


2. Design phase:


1. The design phase involves creating wireframes, mockups, and prototypes to visualize the website layout and user interface.

2. User experience (UX) design focuses on intuitive navigation, clear product categorization, and responsive design for different devices.

3. Technical architecture design includes selecting e-commerce platforms, databases, hosting solutions, and third-party integrations. 

4. Iterative design reviews and feedback sessions ensure that the design meets usability, performance, and branding requirements.


3. Implementation phase:


1. The implementation phase involves developing and configuring the e-commerce website based on design specifications.

2. Front-end development includes HTML/CSS coding, JavaScript functionality for interactive elements, and integration with UX/UI designs.

3. Back-end development involves setting up servers, databases, and server-side scripting for website functionality.

4. Integration with third-party services such as payment gateways, shipping providers, and customer relationship management (CRM) systems is implemented.

5. Quality assurance processes are integrated throughout development to ensure code quality, security, and performance.


4. Testing phase:


1. Testing activities include functional testing, usability testing, security testing, and performance testing.

2. Functional testing verifies that website features and functionalities work as expected, including product search, add to cart, and checkout process.

3. Usability testing evaluates the user interface and navigation to ensure a seamless shopping experience.

4. Security testing identifies vulnerabilities in the website, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and data breaches.

5. Performance testing assesses website responsiveness, load times, and scalability under different traffic conditions.

5. Deployment phase:


1. Deployment involves launching the e-commerce website to production servers and making it accessible to customers.

2. Deployment activities include configuring DNS settings, setting up SSL certificates for secure connections, and configuring caching and content delivery networks (CDNs) for improved performance.

3. Training is provided to internal staff on website administration, content management, and order processing.

4. Marketing and promotional activities are coordinated to drive traffic to the new website and attract customers.

6. Maintenance phase:


1. Maintenance activities include ongoing monitoring, updates, and support to ensure the website's reliability, security, and performance.

2. Regular updates are applied to address software vulnerabilities, add new features, and improve user experience.

3. Customer support channels are established to address inquiries, feedback, and issues promptly.

4. Continuous optimization efforts are made to enhance website performance, conversion rates, and customer satisfaction.
