Assignment 3:


Research and compare SDLC models suitable for engineering projects. Present 
findings on Waterfall, Agile, Spiral, and V-Model approaches, emphasizing their 
advantages, disadvantages, and applicability in different engineering contexts. 



1. Waterfall Model:


Advantages: 


1. Clear structure and sequential phases make it suitable for engineering projects with well-defined and stable requirements. 

2. Extensive documentation at each stage facilitates compliance with regulatory standards and project management.

3. Well-suited for projects with a fixed scope, budget, and timeline where predictability is crucial.


Disadvantages:


1. Limited flexibility to accommodate changes, making it less suitable for projects with evolving requirements.

2. Late feedback from stakeholders may lead to misunderstandings or costly rework.

3. High risk of project failure if requirements are not accurately captured at the beginning.


Applicability: 


Waterfall is best suited for engineering projects with predictable requirements and little expected changes, such as construction projects or infrastructure development.


2.Agile Model:


Advantages:


1. Flexibility and adaptability allow for quick response to changing requirements, making it suitable for engineering projects with evolving needs.

2. Continuous customer involvement ensures alignment with stakeholder expectations and enhances customer satisfaction.

3. Incremental delivery of working software enables early validation and feedback, reducing project risk.


Disadvantages:


1. Lack of predictability may pose challenges for engineering projects with fixed budgets or timelines.

2. Resource-intensive due to the need for highly skilled and dedicated team members.

3. Dependency on active customer involvement may be impractical for certain engineering projects.


Applicability:


 Agile is suitable for engineering projects with uncertain or evolving requirements, such as software development for IoT devices or robotics.


3.Spiral Model:


Advantages:


1. Emphasizes risk management through iterative cycles, making it suitable for engineering projects with high technical risks.

2. Early prototyping allows for validation of design concepts and stakeholder feedback, reducing project uncertainty.

3. Flexibility to accommodate changes and refinements throughout the development process.


Disadvantages:


1. Complexity and overhead associated with risk analysis and management may be impractical for smaller projects.

2. Time and cost may increase due to the iterative nature of the model.

3. Documentation and administrative burden may be significant, particularly for regulatory compliance.


Applicability: 


Spiral model is suitable for engineering projects with significant technical risks or uncertainties, such as aerospace or defense systems.


4.V-Model:


Advantages:


1. Emphasizes verification and validation activities throughout the development lifecycle, ensuring high-quality deliverables.

2. Clear correlation between development and testing phases facilitates comprehensive test coverage.

3. Well-suited for engineering projects with strict regulatory or safety requirements.

Disadvantages:

1. Sequential nature may lead to late detection of issues, making it less suitable for projects with rapidly changing requirements.

2. Limited flexibility to accommodate changes may result in costly rework if requirements evolve.

3. Resource-intensive due to the need for thorough documentation and testing activities. 


Applicability:


 V-Model is suitable for engineering projects where quality assurance and compliance are paramount, such as medical device development or automotive engineering.


In summary, each SDLC model has its own advantages, disadvantages, and applicability in different engineering contexts. The choice of model depends on factors such as project requirements, complexity, and level of uncertainty, as well as organizational capabilities and constraints.
