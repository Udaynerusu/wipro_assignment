Assignment 2: 


Produce a comparative infographic of TDD, BDD, and FDD methodologies. Illustrate their unique approaches, benefits, and suitability for different software development contexts. Use visuals to enhance understanding.


Test-Driven Development (TDD):


Approach:

 Tests are written before code, driving development.


Benefits:


Ensures code correctness by design.

Encourages modular and decoupled code.

Provides a safety net for refactoring.


Suitability:


Best for small to medium-sized projects.

Ideal for iterative development cycles.

Well-suited for teams with a strong testing culture.


Behavior-Driven Development (BDD):


Approach:


 Focuses on user behaviors and system interactions.


Benefits:


Improves collaboration between developers, testers, and non-technical stakeholders.

Enhances clarity and understanding of requirements through scenarios.

Supports the creation of living documentation.


Suitability:


Suitable for projects with complex business logic.

Effective for teams with non-technical stakeholders.

Helps align development with business goals.


Feature-Driven Development (FDD):


Approach:

 Emphasizes on building features incrementally.

Benefits:


Provides a structured approach to software development.

Enables rapid delivery of tangible features.

Facilitates team collaboration and communication.


Suitability:


Well-suited for large-scale projects with multiple teams.

Effective for projects with clearly defined features.

Suitable for environments where predictability is crucial.
